## Лучшее для Flask

Лично проверенно мной в своих проектах.

- **Flask-login** https://github.com/maxcountryman/flask-login

  - Flask-Login provides user session management for Flask. It handles the common tasks of logging in, logging out, and remembering your users' sessions over extended periods of time.

    Flask-Login is not bound to any particular database system or permissions model. The only requirement is that your user objects implement a few methods, and that you provide a callback to the extension capable of loading users from their ID.

- **Flask-SocketIO** https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/Flask-SocketIO

  - **Flask-SocketIO** gives Flask applications access to low latency bi-directional communications between the clients and the server. The client-side application can use any of the [SocketIO](http://socket.io/) official clients libraries in Javascript, C++, Java and Swift, or any compatible client to establish a permanent connection to the server.

- **Flask-WTF** https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

  - Simple integration of [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask) and [WTForms](https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/), including CSRF, file upload, and reCAPTCHA. WTForms is a flexible forms validation and rendering library for Python web development. It can work with whatever web framework and template engine you choose. It supports data validation, CSRF protection, internationalization (I18N), and more. There are various community libraries that provide closer integration with popular frameworks.

- **Flask-Assets** https://flask-assets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

  - Integrates the `webassets` library with Flask, adding support for merging, minifying and compiling CSS and Javascript files.

- **Flask-Admin** https://flask-admin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

  - In a world of micro-services and APIs, Flask-Admin solves the boring problem of building an admin interface on top of an existing data model. With little effort, it lets you manage your web service’s data through a user-friendly interface.
